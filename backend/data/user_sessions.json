The second part, \"nina msongo wa mawazo,\" translates to \"I have a burden of thoughts.\"\n\nSo the user is greeting me and expressing that they have a heavy burden of thoughts, which in a mental health context could indicate stress, anxiety, or feeling overwhelmed. Since the message is in Swahili, I should respond in Swahili to maintain the language preference. I need to acknowledge their greeting, validate their feelings, and offer support.

Let me start by acknowledging their question and offering support. I should ask them to share more about their thoughts so I can assist better. Also, maybe suggest some relaxation techniques in a culturally appropriate way. Use simple Swahili phrases to keep it conversational and comforting. Make sure the tone is warm and understanding. Avoid any technical jargon. Check for any possible misunderstandings. Alright, time to put that into a response.\n</think>\n\nNdiyo, nitasaidia!
